# React Portfolio

Welcome to my React Portfolio! This showcases some of the projects that I am most proud of. The porfolio was built entirely with React.

## Directions

The About Me page shows a picture, a short description of myself and ways that you can contact me. If you are interested, please do. There are also links to my LinkedIn and other social media.

Click on the Portfolio link at the top right to view my portfolio. Each listing contains a screenshot of the application and two links: one to the github repository and one to the deployed application, whether it be on Heroku or Github Pages.

Enjoy!
